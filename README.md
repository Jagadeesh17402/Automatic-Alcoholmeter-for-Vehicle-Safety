### Title: Automatic Alcoholmeter for Vehicle Safety Enhancement

**Project Overview:**

We developed an innovative automatic alcoholmeter integrated with vehicle ignition systems to enhance road safety. Our solution ensures drivers undergo alcohol testing before starting their vehicles. Using an advanced alcohol sensor and robust microcontroller, the system swiftly detects alcohol levels and disables ignition if the driver exceeds safe limits. This technology aims to curb alcohol-related accidents, promoting safer roads and protecting lives.

**Key Technologies and Innovations:**

Our design incorporates:
- **Advanced Alcohol Sensor**: Utilizing state-of-the-art sensor technology for accurate and rapid alcohol detection.
- **Microcontroller System**: Integration of a high-performance microcontroller to manage sensor data and control vehicle ignition.
  
This project addresses critical societal challenges by leveraging cutting-edge technology to mitigate the risks associated with drunk driving, thereby contributing to improved road safety and public health.
